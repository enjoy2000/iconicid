                <strong>Career Counseling</strong>
                <p>
                    We will have career counseling sessions in our <strong>Ho Chi Minh City office or Ha Noi office</strong> with those who reside in Indonesia or via Skype with those who reside outside of Indonesia.

                <strong>Interview by Employer</strong>
                <p>
                    Basically you'll be expected to have an interview with the employer in Indonesia. Therefore, it is recommended to be ready to fly to Indonesia for interview in case you reside outside of Indonesia. However, some employers may sometimes accept to have interview via Skype or TV phone or in Head Quarter in Japan depending on their corporate policy.

                <strong>Start working</strong>
                <p>
                    We'll inform you of the result of the last selection by the employer and negotiate with you the labor conditions such as first working day, salary, benefit etc on behalf of the employer. Once agreed between both parties, you'll start working for the employer.
